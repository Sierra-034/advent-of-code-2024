# Advent of Code 2024 ðŸŽ„âœ¨

Welcome to my **Advent of Code 2024** repository! This is where the magic of coding meets festive problem-solving. Each day of December, we tackle a new challenge designed to test our brains, break some loops, and spread a little holiday cheer - one algorithm at a time!


## ðŸŽ„ Getting Started  

Ready to dive into the code and start solving puzzles like an elf at the North Pole? Here's what you do:

### 1. Clone This Repo  
Grab the code by running:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Sierra-034/advent-of-code-2024.git
cd advent-of-code-2024
```

### 2. Virtual Environment (Optional, but magical)
Keep things neat by setting up a virtual environment:
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

### 3. Install Package as editable  
Make sure you have all the tools you need. This will not only install this as a package but also will install pytest  dependency. At your project's root run:
```bash
pip install -e .

### 4. Run the Magic  
Navigate to `src/` and run the solution for any day:
```bash
python day_X_Y.py
```
Replace `X` with the day number and `Y` with the part of the problem (e.g.,  `day_2_1.py` for day 2, part 1) as each problem is divided in two parts.

## ðŸ§ª Testing the Magic

Want to make sure your solutions are as sharp as Rudolphâ€™s sleigh-driving skills? Run the tests:  
```bash
pytest tests/
```

If all goes well, you'll be greeted with green checks! ðŸŽ‰

## ðŸŒŸ Contributions  

Found a better way to crack the puzzle? Have some optimizations to sprinkle in? Contributions are always welcome! Just fork the repo, make your improvements, and submit a pull request. Donâ€™t forget to include tests to prove your solution shines like a star on top of the tree!
